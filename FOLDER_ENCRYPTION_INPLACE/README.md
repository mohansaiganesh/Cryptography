# Description

The python code 'encrypt_or_decrypt_inplace' either encrypts or decrypts a particular directory without creating a seperate additional directory.
'STATUS.md' file is useful to check whether the directory is already encrypted or not.

So please don't delete 'STATUS.md' file.

Encryption and Decryption actions in a particular directory or sub-directory are purely performed based on the content present 'STATUS.md' file.
